### About This Program
PhysioReach is a mobile application made in Xamarin.Forms that is created to be a physical therapy assistant, helping the user
through common physical therapy exercises.  The app uses the phone's accelerometer to track movement during each
exercise, and creates a graph based on data collected during the exercise.
